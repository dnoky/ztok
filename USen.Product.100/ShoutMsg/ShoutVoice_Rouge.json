  "Talk_30": "This has to be their leader!",
  "Talk_59": "Lightning worked on the others—maybe it\u0027ll\nwork here too!",
  "Rouge_BossHint4_03": "Blasted Gibdos... They just keep coming!",
  "Talk_02": "Enemies are pouring out of the hive near\nthe north gate too! Take them out!",

  "Rouge_BossHint4_12": "Almost there, Link! Let\u0027s finish this!",
  "Talk_11": "Eliminate every enemy you see! We\u0027re the\nlast line of defense!",
