I\u0027ve felt my soul flicker\non the boundary between life and death...\nJust as my body neared its limits, one of\nour intelligence officers shared some\npromising news.\nWhile disguised as a traveler, he hit it\noff with a fledgling tailor and learned\nabout a special stitching technique.\nWe applied that technique to our own\nhelm, and for the first time, it repelled\nlightning.\nOur Lightning Helm was born.",
