  "Talk_09": "I want to master this power so I can use it\nto defeat the Gibdos.\n\nIf I can do that, we can investigate the\nsource of this sand shroud and search for\nZelda, as well!\n\u003csp:3:0:2:0000\u003e\u003csnd:Determination_00\u003eLink! Will you help me with my training?",
  "Talk_03": "That\u0027s thanks to this unusual sand\nshroud. It appeared around the same time\nthe events at Hyrule Castle took place.\n\u003csnd:Angry_00\u003eIt has blanketed the whole desert,\nincluding our town.",
  "Talk_04": "And not long after that, swarms of\nmonsters we\u0027d never seen before began\nattacking. We\u0027re calling them \u003cclr:0000\u003eGibdos\u003cclr:ffff\u003e.",

  "Talk_01": "But to do that, I need to bring a quick\nresolution to a problem we Gerudo\nare facing...",
  "Talk_08": "\u003csnd:Angry_00\u003eBut this technique is...unrefined. I only\nrecently discovered it and still need\nmore practice.",
