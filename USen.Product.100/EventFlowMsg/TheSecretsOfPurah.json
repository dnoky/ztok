  "Comment_04": "I grew frustrated with being treated like a\nchild, so I resumed my age-booster\nexperimentations in earnest.\nThe anti-aging device reversed more than\n100 years in an instant, so I reflected on\nthat result and moderated the output.\nWhen I cautiously exposed myself to its\nrays, I returned to my 20-year-old form,\njust as I had hoped. Success!\nI\u0027m so happy that I can once again reach\nhigh places without using a jetpack.\n\nMy 20-year-old body doesn\u0027t suffer from\nsleepless nights researching. And what\u0027s\nmore, my skin is perfect. No complaints!",
  "Comment_05": "Read Purah\u0027s diary?",
  "Comment_06": "I\u0027ve decided to store this diary in four\nvolumes. That way, if a nosy someone\nreads it, they\u0027ll only have a quarter of it.\nSuch ideas are the fruits of genius!\nAs for the first one...I think I\u0027ll entrust\nit to...who else but Impa.",
  "Comment_12": "Speaking of Impa, she\u0027s had a cute habit\nof hiding important items underneath\nthings ever since she was a child.\nI have a fond memory of when she forgot\nabout a hidden steamed bun beneath a\ncushion and then sat on it. Squashed flat!\nDiaries are flat to begin with, but as they\nare more important than a bun, I hope she\nfinds a better hiding spot than a cushion.",
  "Comment_13": "I haven\u0027t decided where to hide three of\nmy four diary volumes yet. Hmm.",
  "Comment_14": "It seems like a good idea to hide one of\nthem away in my own room...",
  "Comment_20": "The lab there is perfect for hiding things.\nIt\u0027s such a remote location, I\u0027m sure no\none will ever come across it!",
  "Comment_15": "I\u0027ve been at Lookout Landing a lot lately.\nMaybe I should go back to the lab in\nHateno Village to place the diary.",
  "Comment_16": "I\u0027ve decided where to hide the second\nvolume of my diary. For the last two\nspots, maybe I\u0027ll shoot arrows at a map.",
  "Comment_17": "Update: Genius doesn\u0027t translate to being\ngood with a bow. I ended up piercing the\nfloor instead of the map.\nI\u0027ll just leave one volume here at Lookout\nLanding, as indicated by the arrows.",
  "0000": "Read.",
  "Comment_01": "A stairway leading deep beneath\nHyrule Castle has been discovered.\n\nEven Princess Zelda didn\u0027t know about it,\nso it seems safe to assume it\u0027s a secret\nremoved even from royal legend.\nWe have confirmed that gloom emanates\nfrom that location, meaning something\ndown there must be causing it.\nI appointed Princess Zelda and Link\nto investigate.\n\nActually... It would be more accurate to\nsay that Princess Zelda volunteered for\nthe job before I had the chance.\nI know beyond a doubt there is no team\nmore qualified for such a task, and yet...\nI can\u0027t escape this feeling of dread.",
  "0001": "Don\u0027t read.",
  "Comment_02": "Perhaps it\u0027s a side effect of returning to\nmy previous form from 100 years ago,\nbut I had a dream about that time.\nBack then, Robbie and I did whatever we\npleased at the Royal Ancient Lab...\n\nAge-reversal-experimentation explosions.\nWarping-failure explosions. Explosion-\nprevention-device explosions.\nI recall us trying things that likely would\nhave gotten us tossed out if Impa and\nPrincess Zelda hadn\u0027t covered for us.\nImpa scolded me often, but never too\nharshly. Those were fun times.",
  "Comment_19": "Three volumes of my diary are hidden\naway now. I\u0027ll place the last one at the\nnortheastern edge of Akkala.",
  "Comment_03": "I designed the Purah Pad to be capable of\nvarious experiments in hopes of carrying\nsome of the burden for Hyrule\u0027s recovery.\nRobbie built a prototype right away,\nand we asked the princess to use it\nin her work across Hyrule.\nPrincess Zelda learned quickly and was\nquite delighted to capture test pictures\nwith the \u003cclr:0000\u003ecamera\u003cclr:ffff\u003e.\nThe \u003cclr:0000\u003ecamera\u003cclr:ffff\u003e was intended for use in\ninvestigations, but it\u0027s possible it could\nalso be useful in everyday life.\nPerhaps after the recovery, a time will\ncome when everyone has their very own\nPurah Pad. Hee-hee, just imagine!"
