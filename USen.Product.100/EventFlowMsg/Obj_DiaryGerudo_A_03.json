  "talk0001": "The desert has been as calm as I\u0027ve ever\nseen it for quite some time now. No raids,\nno monster attacks, no bandit incidents.\nI should be happy about that, but it\u0027s my\njob to keep an eye out and report any\nevents that are out of the ordinary.\nAnd when nothing is happening, I have\nnothing to do. But no matter how quiet\nit gets, I can\u0027t leave my post.\nI know how important this task is, but\nthat doesn\u0027t keep me from getting bored.\nI should be grateful for the peace...",

I\u0027ve been asked to supervise the\nnew training area being built at the\nSouthern Oasis.\nI feel honored to be trusted with training\nour soldiers. It\u0027s a direct way to help keep\nthe desert safe...\nI\u0027ve learned a lot from watching over the\ndesert here—it\u0027s time to put it to use by\nteaching others what I know!"
