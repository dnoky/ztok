You just have to\nexperiment!\nAnd don\u0027t forget! Combining ingredients\nwith the same effect may increase the\neffect\u0027s strength or duration...\nBut combining ingredients with different\neffects may cancel their enhancing\neffects out, so you must be careful.\nI, Aurie Taamu, am admittedly quite\nimpatient, so I always have speed-\nincreasing \u003cclr:0000\u003ehasty foods\u003cclr:ffff\u003e on hand!",

That\u0027s basic math!\nDid I learn all this from experience? No,\nof course not! I learned it from a friend!\nA dear friend!
