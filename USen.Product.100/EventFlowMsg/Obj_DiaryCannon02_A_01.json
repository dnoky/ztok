I don\u0027t know how a\nsound from outside made it that far down.\nWe will investigate tomorrow.",

  "Talk_0007": "Day Ten\n\n\nThe tower is done! It was a breeze with\nPurah\u0027s clever design and the skillful\nprep work by Hudson Construction.\nAll of that legwork kept on-site assembly\nsimple and efficient.\n\nSince we may end up using the site again,\nwe decided to leave some materials in\nthe cave.\nThe first thing I\u0027ll do when I get off this\nmountain is have a warm bowl of soup.",

We had to stop\nand take shelter in a nearby cave.\nGood newsâ€”the cave is warm and safe.\nWe decided to use it as our base camp\nfor the rest of the project."
