  "Search": "According to Chork, the white goats ran off\nafter they were given a special feed made from\na recipe Princess Zelda created. The only thing\nleft behind when they fled were uneaten \u003cclr:0000\u003eHylian\npine cones\u003cclr:ffff\u003e.\n\nDid the goats really run off because of the food\nthey were given? Where did they run off to?",
  "Hearing": "It seems that all of the \u003cclr:0000\u003ewhite goats \u003cclr:ffff\u003ekept in\nTabantha Bridge Stable have run off together.\nAccording to Penn, these events may somehow\nconnect to Princess Zelda.\n\nYou may learn more by speaking with the\nstable hand, \u003cclr:0000\u003eChork\u003cclr:ffff\u003e, who is responsible for\nthe white goats.",
  "Complete": "You\u0027ve found the white goats that went missing.\nChork is incredibly remorseful for having messed\nup the animal-feed recipe, and even more\nremorseful for having doubted Princess Zelda\u0027s\nrecipe in the first place. After you told Penn\nwhat happened, he returned to the newspaper\nto write up an article about the events."
