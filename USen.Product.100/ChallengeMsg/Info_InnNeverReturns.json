  "Search": "Dai was asked to watch over an inn, and he\u0027s\nstarting to worry that the owner\u0027s not coming\nback. He asked you to try to find him.\n\nIt seems the owner had gone out to change the\nsurvey team\u0027s bedsheets. Their tents are\nlocated in four different areas though, so Dai\u0027s\nnot sure where the owner could be.",
  "Report": "You found the inn\u0027s owner, Ollie, sleeping in a\nsurvey-team tent. You woke him up with a\nwhiff of a hearty truffle, and he hurried back\nto the inn.\n\nYou should do the same, just to see how things\nare going over there.",
  "Complete": "Ollie\u0027s return to the inn freed Dai from the\nresponsibility of watching over it.\n\nAnd better yet, now you can sleep there."
