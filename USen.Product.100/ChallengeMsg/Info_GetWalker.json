  "Name": "Presenting: Hero\u0027s Path Mode!",
  "Step01": "Apparently the Purah Pad has a feature called\n\u003cclr:0000\u003ehero\u0027s path mode\u003cclr:ffff\u003e that allows you to review\nwhere you\u0027ve been. However, calibrating the\nupgrade will require \u003cclr:0000\u003edata from 15 shrine\nlocations\u003cclr:ffff\u003e.\n\nHave Robbie make the modifications once you\nhave the data.",
