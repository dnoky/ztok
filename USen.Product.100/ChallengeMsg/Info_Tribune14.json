  "Name": "The Blocked Well",
  "Step1": "Penn\u0027s sources told him that Princess Zelda\nordered the well to be made off-limits, but the\nreason she did so is a mystery.\n\nPenn thinks it\u0027d be helpful to go down the well\nto look for clues, but his wings are too wide for\nhim to fit.",
  "Step2": "After climbing down into the well, you found a\nrock wall inside and broke it—revealing a cave\ncrawling with monsters.\n\nFor the safety of those at the stable, you\nshould probably defeat them.",
  "Complete": "You told Penn what was going on at the bottom\nof the well. Now, it\u0027s clear why Princess Zelda\ndidn\u0027t want anyone to use the well—there was\na den of monsters down there, and she must\nhave known about it. Penn is relieved to have\nthis mystery sorted out. He\u0027s going to write up\nthe whole story for the newspaper."
